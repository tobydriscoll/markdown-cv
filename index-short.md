<!-- ## Teaching
### Philosophy
While I enjoy lecturing, I no longer believe it should be the only or even primary way of teaching most math classes. The marginal benefits of a live lecture over a recorded one are overshadowed by supervised active learning, where the instructor shares expertise with students as they wrestle with the material themselves. I use techniques such as problem-based learning, laboratory exploration, personal response systems, and flipping the classroom to create active learning opportunities. In addition, I believe mathematics needs to embrace teaching computation throughout the curriculum, rather than quarantining it into a few courses or lab sections.
